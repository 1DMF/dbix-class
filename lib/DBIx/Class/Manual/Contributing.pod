DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing - Index of contributors manuals

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation part is dedicated to the coordination of the development of
[DBIx::Class](http://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class). The information
presented here is not intended for regular users of this distribution, but
instead targets people who want to help and support the DBIx::Class project
(from here on referred to as DBIC).

If you only want information about using DBIx::Class this is the wrong place.
Instead please go to the
[DBIx::Class Manual](http://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class::Manual).

=head1 INDEX

=head2 L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing::Intro>

Main introduction and overview of all relevant ressources.

=head2 L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing::Branches>

This is the most relevant part of the contribution documentation for the
developers and addresses the current problems or the current running feature
requests. It's not meant to be a ticket system, but more of a “birds eye view”
of the current state of things. The absolute current state is determined by the
(to be documented) B<dbictodo> tool.

=head2 L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing::Repository>

Informations about the usage of the repository.

=head2 L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing::Contact>

This section covers the communication channels available for the contributors
of L<DBIx::Class>.

=head2 L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing::Testing>

This section covers up information you might need regarding testing with
L<DBIx::Class>. This includes information about how to write failing tests, how
YOU can help testing new releases with your own testsuite, and how we can
progress to make the testing even more automatically for other engines. It also
explains the relevant parts of the test suite (i.e. there seems to be a large
misconception that having the suite run against different engines is what
counts the most). Also the beginnings of a spec for a L<DBI> (in general) and
L<DBIx::Class> "use at home" testing VM.

=head2 L<DBIx::Class::Manual::Contributing::Marketing>

This section will try to give all information you might need to animate others
to use and/or contribute to DBIC. The lower hanging fruit is to get people to
start using Perl in general, but the section mainly focuses on how using an OO
wrapper helps one access their data.
